# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server for building PowerPoint presentations. The repository is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Architecture

This project is designed to implement an MCP server that enables AI assistants to create and manipulate PowerPoint presentations programmatically.

## Development Environment

Always use Python 3 and activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Important instructions

Always design a feature first, and ask me to review the design before implementing it.

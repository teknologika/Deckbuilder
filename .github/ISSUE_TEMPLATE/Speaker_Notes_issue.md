**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, there is no way to add speaker notes to a presentation. This makes it difficult for presenters to remember key points and deliver a smooth presentation.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
I would like to be able to add speaker notes to my presentations. These notes should be visible to me when I am presenting, but not to the audience. I would like to be able to add notes using a `speaker_notes` field in the JSON and markdown frontmatter.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I have considered using a separate application to manage my speaker notes, but this is not ideal. It would be much better to have the notes integrated directly into the presentation.

**Additional context**
The implementation details for this feature are outlined in the [Speaker Notes design document](docs/Features/Speaker_Notes.md).

# Speaker Notes Feature - ✅ COMPLETE

## 1. Introduction

**STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - This document details the completed speaker notes functionality in Deckbuilder. This professional feature allows users to include comprehensive presentation notes that are visible to the presenter but not the audience, with full rich text formatting support.

## 2. Core Architecture Changes

*   **`slide_builder.py`:**
    *   A new method, `add_speaker_notes(slide, notes_content)`, will be added.
    *   This method will be called from `build_slide` after the main content has been added.
    *   It will use the `python-pptx` library to access the notes slide of the given slide (`slide.notes_slide`) and add the notes content to the `notes_text_frame`.

*   **Canonical JSON Format:**
    *   The JSON schema for a slide will be extended to include an optional `speaker_notes` field.
    *   Example:
        ```json
        {
          "title": "My Slide",
          "content": [
            "This is the slide content."
          ],
          "speaker_notes": "These are my speaker notes."
        }
        ```

## 3. Content Integration

*   **`structured_frontmatter.py`:**
    *   The frontmatter parsing logic will be updated to recognize a `speaker_notes` key.
    *   The content of this key will be passed to the `SlideBuilder`.
    *   Example Markdown Frontmatter:
        ```markdown
        ---
        title: My Slide
        speaker_notes: |
          These are my speaker notes.
          They can even span multiple lines.
        ---

        # Slide Content
        ```

*   **`content_formatting.py`:**
    *   The existing `ContentFormatter` will be used to format the speaker notes content, allowing for rich text formatting (bold, italics, etc.).

## 4. MCP Tools

*   The MCP tools will be updated to recognize and process speaker notes from Markdown input.
*   Validation will be added to ensure that the speaker notes content is valid.

## 5. Testing

*   Unit tests will be added for the `add_speaker_notes` method in `slide_builder.py`.
*   Integration tests will be created to verify the end-to-end functionality, from Markdown input to the final PowerPoint presentation.
*   Tests will cover:
    *   Presentations with and without speaker notes.
    *   Rich text formatting in speaker notes.
    *   Multi-line speaker notes.
